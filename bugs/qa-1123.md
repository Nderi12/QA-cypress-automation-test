# This markdown file shows an actual incident

## Introduction
I would like to bring to your attention that there is a frontend problem with the system's error message display. Currently, when incorrect credentials are entered in admin user login page, the error message is displayed in JSON format instead of the expected text format for users..

# Reproducing error
1. Go to https://pet-shop.buckhill.com.hr/login

2. Enter wrong email: test@buckhill.co.ke

3. Enter wrong password: @password!

4. Click on login button

# Error message

{ "success": 0, "data": [], "error": "Failed to authenticate user", "errors": [], "trace": [] }

# Expected error message

Failed to authenticate user
